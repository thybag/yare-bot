# A basic bot for yare.io

A simple helper library for yare.io including a sample bot utilsing it.
This bot is currently fairly dumb, only implimenting basic charging/defending and attacking with minimal tactics.

See [yare.io](yare.io) for details on the game.

Notes:
- `Run` & `Init` functions are implimented outside of the Entity object in order to allow these to be updated at run time. The Entities themselves perisit within the memory object.
